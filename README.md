# Fashion Multi-Label Attribute Classifier

This project uses deep learning to classify fashion product images into four key attributes:
- **Color** of the product
- **Product Type** (e.g., T-shirt, Shoes, etc.)
- **Season** (e.g., Summer, Winter)
- **Gender** (Men, Women, Unisex)

## Model Description
The model uses a **multi-output Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to predict the above attributes from a single fashion product image. 
- **TensorFlow 2.3.0** and **Keras** were used to build and train the model.
- The model is trained on fashion product images and can make predictions based on images of fashion items.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.5**
- **TensorFlow 2.3.0**
- **Keras**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **OpenCV**
