# Fashion Multi-Label Attribute Classifier

This project uses a deep learning model to classify fashion product images into four attributes:
- **Color** of the product
- **Product Type** (e.g., T-shirt, Shoes, etc.)
- **Season** (e.g., Summer, Winter)
- **Gender** (Men, Women, Unisex)

The model is integrated into a simple web app using Flask, allowing users to upload images and receive predictions through a browser interface.
